# 🧠 Thyroid Disease Prediction

## 📘 Description
This project aims to develop and evaluate a machine learning model to predict thyroid disease using patient data. The dataset includes various features relevant to thyroid conditions, and the workflow covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The model helps in early diagnosis and effective treatment planning for thyroid disorders.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Loading and Preparation**: Load and prepare the dataset from a CSV file, handle missing values, and convert columns if needed.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize features, split data into training and testing sets, and perform feature scaling.
- **Model Training**: Train a `CatBoostingClassifier` on the preprocessed data to classify thyroid conditions.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Use classification metrics and visualize results with a confusion matrix heatmap.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations such as confusion matrix heatmaps to understand model performance.

## 📊 Example Analysis

### 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **File Used**: `thyroid-disease.data`  
- **Content**: Patient health parameters related to thyroid function (e.g., TSH, T3, TT4, FTI, etc.)

### 🤖 Model
- **Model Used**: `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` from scikit-learn
- **Purpose**: Classify patients into thyroid condition categories based on numerical and categorical features.

### 📈 Performance Metrics
| Metric     | Value (Approx.) |
|------------|-----------------|
